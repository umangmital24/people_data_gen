# People Data Generator

This tool is a powerful lead generation pipeline that automates the process of finding and verifying contact information for potential customers. It leverages various APIs and a language model to generate targeted leads based on a product description.

## Features

- **Automated Lead Generation:** The entire pipeline, from generating search terms to verifying contacts, is automated.
- **Targeted Lead Generation:** Uses a language model to generate highly specific Google Places search terms based on a product description.
- **Data Enrichment:** Scrapes company data from Google Places and can merge it with data from other sources like LinkedIn.
- **Contact Finding and Verification:** Finds contact information for employees at target companies using the Apollo.io API and verifies their email addresses using the NeverBounce API.
- **Modular and Configurable:** The pipeline is divided into modular steps that can be easily enabled or disabled. API keys and other settings are managed in a configuration file.

## How it Works

The lead generation pipeline consists of the following steps:

1.  **Generate Search Terms:** The tool uses a language model (Ollama or Google Gemini) to generate a lead generation plan based on a product description provided in `src/config.py`. This plan includes a list of target groups and corresponding Google Places search terms.
2.  **Scrape Google Places:** The tool uses the generated search terms to scrape company data from Google Places. This data includes company name, address, website, phone number, and more.
3.  **Process and Merge Data:** The scraped data is then processed to filter out irrelevant companies based on industry and country. It can also be merged with data from other sources (e.g., a LinkedIn data file) and deduplicated.
4.  **Find and Verify Contacts:** For each company, the tool uses the Apollo.io API to find employees and their contact information. It then uses the NeverBounce API to verify the validity of their email addresses.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- Git

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/people_data_gen.git
    cd people_data_gen
    ```
2.  Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Configuration

1.  Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project.
2.  Add your API keys and other configuration variables to the `.env` file. The following variables are supported:

    ```
    GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY="YOUR_GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY"
    APOLLO_API_KEY="YOUR_APOLLO_API_KEY"
    NEVERBOUNCE_API_KEY="YOUR_NEVERBOUNCE_API_KEY"
    GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"
    HUGGINGFACE_API_TOKEN="YOUR_HUGGINGFACE_API_TOKEN"
    OLLAMA_BASE_URL="http://localhost:11434"
    ```

    **Note:** `HUGGINGFACE_API_TOKEN` is not currently used but is kept for future expansion. `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` defaults to `http://localhost:11434` if not set.

3.  Configure the pipeline settings in `src/config.py`. You can define the `PRODUCT_DESCRIPTION`, `LEAD_SCORE_THRESHOLD`, `CONTACT_PERSONAS`, and other settings.

## Usage

To run the lead generation pipeline, execute the `main.py` script:

```bash
python main.py
```

You can enable or disable specific steps of the pipeline by modifying the `pipeline_config` dictionary in `main.py`.

## Input

The main input for the tool is the `PRODUCT_DESCRIPTION` variable in `src/config.py`. This description is used to generate the lead generation plan.

You can also provide a LinkedIn company information file (`LinkedIn_company_information.json`) in the `output` directory to merge with the Google Places data.

## Output

The tool generates the following output files in the `output` directory:

- `lead_plan.json`: The lead generation plan generated by the language model.
- `companies.json`: The company data scraped from Google Places.
- `final_merged_companies.json`: The merged and deduplicated company data.
- `verified_employees.json`: The list of verified employees and their contact information.

## How to Make Changes

The source code is located in the `src` directory. The main files are:

- `main.py`: The main entry point of the application.
- `src/config.py`: The configuration file for the application.
- `src/gen_search_terms.py`: The module for generating search terms.
- `src/google_places_wrapper.py`: The module for scraping Google Places.
- `src/data_processor.py`: The module for processing and merging data.
- `src/contact_finder.py`: The module for finding and verifying contacts.
- `src/email_verifier.py`: The module for verifying email addresses.

You can modify these files to customize the functionality of the tool. For example, you can change the language model used for generating search terms, add new data sources, or modify the contact finding and verification logic.
