        - The rationale must be concise (2-3 sentences) and business-focused,

        - Google Places search terms must be city-level or sub-region-specific (avoid broad regions like "USA" or "North America").
        - Prefer to include multiple relevant cities or hubs for each group. For example, instead of "fintech companies USA", generate terms like:
          "fintech companies in New York", "fintech companies in San Francisco", "fintech companies in Austin", instead of "fintech companies Delhi NCR", generate terms like:
          "fintech companies in Noida", "fintech companies in Gurugram", "fintech companies in Delhi".
        - Provide 8-10 distinct Google Places search phrases per group to maximize coverage.
